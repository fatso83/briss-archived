# BRISS - archived source

## What is this?
This archive is a Git exported repository of the original 
Sourceforge Subversion repository, where I have laid down
some effort into preserving the original commits. 

## Why?
There are multiple forks of this old project, but few have taken the time
to preserve the original commits and work of the original 
authors, Gerhard Aigner and Rastislav Wartiak, which
I think they deserve.

This should serve as a basis for new forks. Or existing
forks could graft a new history on top of this, if they were
really nice ... :)

## How to use this repo?
Fork it and trim off (`git rebase -i v0.9.0)`) the commit(s) made by me :)

## How to use the software?
See the original [README.txt](./README.txt) for how to use it.

Nowadays, there are several forks, of which the most promising
non-dead seems to be this one:

- [Briss 2.0](https://github.com/mbaeuerle/Briss-2.0)
